Hacking Was Never about "How to hack" this and that , there is so many youtube channels out there who make videos like "how to hack " or how to use a certain tool , rather then explaining the underlying concepts.
understanding concepts on a lower level , and using those concepts to discover and break things,is what i call hacking .
that's how at least i look at it,but it really takes a lot of time and unfortunately it's not that simple..
I believe the following quote holds true, so don't expect to become a skilled hacker in one night
```
anyone can master a skill with 10,000 hours of practice

```
so what i recommend doing is : 
>Learn How to use Linux 
>
>Learn About Assembly and C 
>
>I highly Recommend Watching This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navuBR4aJSs&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&index=2"> Youtube Playlist </a> 
>
>Practice programming - it doesn't matter what (website, game, mobile app, ...)
>
>Don't pay for shitty "ethical hacking courses"
>
>Watch LiveOverFlow Or JohnHammond.
>
>Play random CTFs from <a href="https://ctftime.org"> ctftime </a> and afterwards study writeups of challenges you couldn't solve
>
>Play wargames like overthewire, PicoCTF
