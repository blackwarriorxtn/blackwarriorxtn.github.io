## Walkthrough

 but there is Pikalang wich is a joke esoteric programming language and its identical to brainfuck , except that the instructions are changed into the sounds made by Pikachu From Pok√©mon ,as you can see the table below each word have its instructions

 we can use an interpreter to see what this means ,i found this one that is written in python and it works find thanks to

 compiling it using the given interpreter will write out "hello world"
 
 we go back to nc and write HELLO WORLD , we get another esoteric lang

 which is very obviously brainfuck , a simple google search is enough to identify it 
 and for that we can use this online interpreter https://copy.sh/brainfuck/
 after running we get "This is f**/king my brain" so lets go and write that

this time we get the esoteric lang called Malbolge and by using this interpreter
 http://malbolge.doleczek.pl/ we will be able to get the flag
```
flag :

b00t2root{e50t3ric_langu4g35_ar3_1n5an3}
```
